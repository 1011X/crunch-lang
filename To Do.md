# To Do

- [ ] Compiler Pipeline
  - [X] Read file
    - [ ] Make sure files aren't re-processed
  - [X] Tokenize
  - [ ] Parse into AST
    - [ ] Uncoil the beast that is the parser
      - [X] Pratt Parsing
      - [ ] Decide about decorator declarations, should they be a separate type of declaration?
        - [ ] Allows declaration-only namespacing
        - [ ] Allows greater freedom with system to allow codegen/macro type utilities
      - [ ] Unit type
      - [ ] Syntax highlighting
      - [ ] Throwing errors
      - [ ] Floats
      - [ ] Escape sequences
  - [ ] Semantic Checking
  - [ ] Generate HIR & Desugar
  - [ ] Type Checking
  - [ ] High-level Optimization
  - [ ] Const folding
  - [ ] Generate LLIR
  - [ ] Resolve Stack and Register operations
  - [ ] Optimization
  - [ ] Generate bytecode
  - [ ] Final bytecode-level Optimization
  - [ ] Emit or Execute
- [ ] Make all parsers state machines
  - [ ] Prevents stack overflows
- [ ] Make all translators/parsers/generators state machines
- [ ] Fully qualified HIR
  - [ ] Desugared
  - [ ] Type Methods are turned into stand-alone functions
- [ ] Three-address representation for LLIR
  - [ ] Rework, needs to be better thought out
- [ ] Fix issue #36, issue in vice with range-related codegen
  - [ ] `vice::vice::tests::range_test`
  - [ ] `vice::vice::tests::fibonacci_iterative`
  - [ ] Implement more real-world tests
- [ ] Fix benchmarks, broken by move to new stdout system in Compactor
- [ ] Start writing programs in Crunch
  - [ ] Implement popular, easy or common problems
  - [ ] Create large 'examples' directory with lots of source code
  - [ ] Start writing std, even if it's not currently 100% usable
- [ ] Ditch proptest dependency
- [ ] Fix printing tests
- [ ] Break CrashReport into own crate & implement features requested in #35
- [ ] Work on parallel compilation
  - [ ] FIFO Queue for parsing files
    - [ ] Stateless parser shared between threads
  - [ ] Workers push new files to the queue
    - [ ] Shared set of files already covered
  - [ ] Workers Parse files and push the finished to somewhere
  - [ ] Concurrent String interner
    - [ ] Dashmap-based
- [ ] `no_std` RwLock and Mutex implementations
- [ ] Fast concurrent queue
- [ ] Get rid of phf
